 1. Introduction
In this assignment, I set up a comprehensive developer environment tailored to software engineering projects. This involved selecting an operating system, installing essential tools like text editors, version control systems, and programming languages, configuring a database, and exploring optional tools like virtualization and IDE extensions. Here is a detailed account of the steps I took, along with the challenges I faced and the strategies I employed to overcome them.

 2. Operating System Selection and Installation
Chosen OS: Windows 11  
Reason: Windows 11 offers a user-friendly interface, broad compatibility with software tools, and strong support for development environments.

Steps:
1. Download: I downloaded the Windows 11 installation media from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11).
2. Installation: Followed the on-screen instructions to install Windows 11 on my machine.
3. Configuration: Configure system settings to optimize for development, such as enabling virtualization in the BIOS and setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

 3. Text Editor/IDE Installation
Chosen IDE: Visual Studio Code  
Reason: VS Code is highly customizable, supports a wide range of programming languages, and has a rich ecosystem of extensions.

Steps:
1. Download: I downloaded Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
2. Installation: Followed the installation wizard to install VS Code.
3. Configuration: Customized settings such as theme, font size, and installed essential extensions.

 4. Version Control System Setup
Tool: Git  
Repository Hosting: GitHub

Steps:
1. Install Git: Downloaded and installed Git from the [official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Configuration: Configured Git with my user information:
    ```bash
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
    ```
3. GitHub Account: Created a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com).
4. Repository Initialization:
    from gitbash
    mkdir Plp doc
    cd plp doc
    git init

5. First Commit:
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin 
    git push -u origin master
 5. Programming Languages and Runtimes Installation
Language: Python

Steps:
1. Download: I downloaded Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Installation: Followed the installation wizard, ensuring the "Add Python to PATH" option was selected.
3. Verification:
    ```bash
    python --version
    pip --version
    ```

 6. Package Managers Installation
Tool: pip (Python)

Steps:
1. Verification: pip is included with Python, so I verified its installation:
    ```bash
    pip --version
    ```

 7. Database Configuration
Database: MySQL

Steps:
1. Download: I downloaded the MySQL installer from the [official website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html).
2. Installation: Followed the installation wizard to install MySQL.
3. Configuration: Set up a root password and created a sample database for development.

 8. Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional)
Tool: Docker

Steps:
1. Download: Downloaded Docker Desktop from the [official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Installation: Followed the installation instructions.
3. Verification: Ran a sample container to verify the installation:
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

 9. Extensions and Plugins
Extensions for VS Code:
- Python
- GitLens
- Docker
- Prettier - Code formatter

Steps:
1. Installation: Used the built-in extensions marketplace in VS Code to install the necessary extensions.
2. Configuration: Configured each extension as per my development needs.

 10. Documenting the Setup Process
I created a comprehensive document detailing the steps I took, along with screenshots at each significant step to aid in clarity.

 11. Challenges and Strategies
Challenges:
1. Compatibility Issues: Encountered issues with software compatibility on Windows 11.
2. Configuration Errors: Faced errors during Git configuration and MySQL setup.
3. I had to delete and reintall python twice because of pip

Strategies:
1. Research: Conducted thorough research to find solutions for compatibility issues.
2. Community Support: Utilised forums and community support for troubleshooting configuration errors.
3. Documentation: Kept detailed notes and screenshots to track progress and resolve issues efficiently.

 Conclusion
By completing this setup, I have created a robust developer environment that enhances productivity and ensures a smooth workflow. The skills and knowledge gained through this process will be invaluable for future software engineering projects.
